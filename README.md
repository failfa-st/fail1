## About this project

The statement "This project is built to fail (until it doesn't)" implies that the project is
designed to initially fail but ultimately succeed after undergoing a process of evolution. This
suggests that the project is intended to demonstrate the power of evolution and how it can be used
to produce increasingly sophisticated code over time.

The main goal of the script is to create a species of code that understands the concept of evolution
and can produce offspring that are better adapted to their environment. In other words, the program
is designed to mimic the process of natural selection by generating code that evolves and improves
based on certain criteria or fitness functions.

One way to achieve this is by using a genetic algorithm, which is a type of optimization algorithm
inspired by natural selection. The genetic algorithm works by creating a population of potential
solutions (or "individuals") to a problem and then applying various operations, such as mutation and
crossover, to evolve the population over time. Each individual is assigned a fitness score based on
how well it solves the problem at hand, and individuals with higher fitness scores are more likely
to be selected for reproduction.

In the context of this script, the "species" would be the population of potential code solutions,
and the "offspring" would be the new generations of code generated by the program. The fitness
function could be based on how well the code solves a particular problem or meets certain criteria,
such as speed or efficiency. The program could then use a genetic algorithm to evolve the code over
time, with each new generation improving upon the previous one based on the fitness function.

Overall, the goal of this script is to demonstrate the power of evolution and how it can be used to
produce increasingly sophisticated code. By mimicking the process of natural selection, the program
can generate code that is better adapted to its environment and ultimately achieves its goals.

### Adding natural selection

Implementing a fitness function and integrating the concept of natural selection into the existing
code would require several changes to be made. Here are some general steps that could be taken:

1. Define a fitness function: The first step would be to define a fitness function that measures how
well each individual (i.e., potential code solution) solves the problem at hand. This could be based
on various criteria, such as accuracy, speed, efficiency, or any other metric that is relevant to
the problem being solved.

2. Generate a population: Once a fitness function has been defined, the program would need to generate
an initial population of potential code solutions. These could be generated randomly or based on
some other criteria, such as using a set of known good solutions as a starting point.

3. Evaluate fitness: After generating the initial population, the program would need to evaluate the
fitness of each individual based on the defined fitness function. The fitness scores would then be
used to determine which individuals are selected for reproduction in the next generation.

4. Implement natural selection: To implement natural selection, the program would need to apply various
genetic operations, such as mutation and crossover, to the selected individuals in order to generate
offspring that are better adapted to the problem at hand. The offspring would then be evaluated for
fitness and the process would continue for multiple generations.

5. Iterate: The process of generating new generations and selecting for fitness would need to be
repeated for multiple iterations until a satisfactory solution is found.

To implement these changes, the program would need to be modified to include functions for
generating new individuals, evaluating fitness, and implementing genetic operations. These functions
could be added to the existing "base.js" file, and the "generation-000.js" file could be modified to
use these functions to generate and evolve the code. Additionally, the "createMessage" function in
"base.js" could be modified to include the fitness score as part of the message template, so that
the fitness of each individual is tracked in the changelog.

## Basics

The provided code consists of two files, "base.js" and "generation-000.js". The "base.js" file
contains the core logic of the program, while "generation-000.js" is the starting point of the
evolution process.

## Configuration

In "base.js", the program imports the required modules and defines the necessary configuration for
making API calls to OpenAI. It also defines a function "createMessage" that returns a message
template with specific rules to follow for evolving the code. The function "evolve" is responsible
for generating a new code by calling the OpenAI API and writing the generated code to a file with a
specific filename pattern. The program also exports a constant "generations" that defines the
maximum number of evolutions that the program will run.

## Evolution

In "generation-000.js", the program imports the necessary modules and constants from "base.js". It
sets the current generation to 0 and the next generation to 1. The program then reads the code from
the file with the filename that matches the current generation, and passes it to the "evolve"
function along with the next generation number. If the current generation is less than the maximum
number of generations defined in "base.js", the program will generate a new code and continue to the
next generation until the maximum number of generations is reached.

## Rules

The program follows strict rules that must be respected at all times, as outlined in the comments in
both files. The goal is to evolve the code while respecting the rules and without breaking the
existing code. The program uses the OpenAI API to generate new code and write it to files, which are
then imported and executed in subsequent generations.

## Changelog

In "base.js", one of the rules states to "Keep track of changes in the CHANGELOG." This means that
the program should maintain a changelog that tracks all the changes made to the code with each new
generation. The "generation-000.js" file already includes a simple changelog that lists the initial
implementation of the program. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that the program's evolution
can be tracked and managed over time, which can help with debugging and troubleshooting if any
issues arise. By keeping a record of all changes, it is easier to identify when a particular problem
started and what may have caused it.

## Goal

Please note that the GOAL mentioned in "generation-000.js" is an example and can be adjusted as
needed. The program's objective is to continuously evolve the code by generating new versions based
on the existing code, while adhering to the rules set forth in "base.js". The program is designed to
use the OpenAI API to generate new code, which means that it will rely on the AI's own opinions and
capabilities to determine how the code should evolve. The program is not limited to any specific
goal or output, but is intended to develop and improve the code over time. By following the rules
and leveraging the power of the OpenAI API, the program can generate increasingly sophisticated code
with each new generation.
