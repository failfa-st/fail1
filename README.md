## Introducing a Revolutionary Generative Process

Get ready to witness the future of software development! We present to you a revolutionary
generative process that utilizes OpenAI's powerful GPT-3.5 language model. By following strict rules
defined in the code, this process creates a series of JavaScript files, each building upon the
previous one, all with the goal of writing a mandelbrot function that draws ASCII and logs the
output in each generation. Witness the incredible potential of machine learning in assisting with
creative problem-solving in software development like never before!

## Examples (Generation 2)

```js
/**
 * CHANGELOG:
 * Generation 0: implement base script
 * Generation 1: implement mandelbrot function
 * Generation 2: improve mandelbrot function, add colors
 */
```

## Rules

The generative process implemented by the JavaScript files base.js and generation-000.js follows
strict rules that must be respected at all times. These rules are outlined in the comments in both
files and serve as guidelines for extending the code. The goal of the generative process is to
evolve the code while respecting the rules and without breaking the existing code.

The process uses the OpenAI API to generate new code and writes it to files, which are then imported
and executed in subsequent generations. The rules are designed to ensure that the code produced by
the generative process remains consistent and valid while allowing for creative flexibility in
achieving the ultimate goal of creating a mandelbrot function that draws ASCII and logs the output
to the console in each generation.

## Exceptions

Despite the strict rules, the generative process also allows for exceptions, which have a higher
weight than the rules. These exceptions are meant to provide flexibility in the creative process
while still working towards the ultimate goal of creating a mandelbrot function that draws ASCII and
logs the output to the console in each generation.

## Goal

The goal of the generative process is to create a mandelbrot function that draws ASCII and logs the
output to the console in each generation. The process generates a series of JavaScript files, each
building upon the previous one while ensuring that the rules are followed.

## Changelog

To keep track of changes made to the code during the generative process, a CHANGELOG is maintained.
Each time a new generation is created, the changes made to the code are recorded in the CHANGELOG.

## Evolution

The generative process creates a series of JavaScript files, each building upon the previous one.
The process is driven by the OpenAI GPT-3.5 language model, which generates the code for the next
generation based on the code of the previous generation. The evolve function defined in the base.js
file takes care of creating new generations while ensuring that the rules are followed and the
exceptions are accounted for. The process stops after five generations, or when the goal is
achieved.

## Conclusion

The generative process implemented by the JavaScript files base.js and generation-000.js utilizes
OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model to create a series of JavaScript files, each building upon the
previous one. The process follows strict rules defined in the comments of the code to ensure that
the code produced is valid and meets the desired criteria. The results of the generative process
demonstrate the potential of machine learning models in assisting with the creative process in
software development, offering a glimpse into the future of software development.
